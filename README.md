# Drug-Classification-using-state-of-the-art-ML-Drug Classification using State-of-the-Art ML Algorithms
Welcome to our Drug Classification project repository! In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to classify drugs based on their attributes. Our goal is to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately predicting the class of a given drug based on its features.

Overview
Drug classification plays a crucial role in healthcare, aiding in the identification and categorization of various pharmaceutical compounds. With advancements in ML and AI, we have the opportunity to automate and enhance this process, leading to more efficient drug discovery and development pipelines.

Objectives
Data Collection: Our first step is to gather a comprehensive dataset containing information about different drugs. This dataset includes attributes such as chemical properties, therapeutic uses, side effects, and more.
Data Preprocessing: Once we have collected the data, we need to preprocess it to ensure its quality and usability for model training. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, as well as scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is a critical step in the ML pipeline. We aim to extract relevant features from the dataset and engineer new features that capture important relationships between variables. This process helps improve the model's predictive performance.
Model Development: With the preprocessed data and engineered features in hand, we train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms. We explore a variety of algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting, and neural networks, to identify the best-performing model for drug classification.
Model Evaluation: To assess the performance of our models, we use appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We compare the performance of different algorithms and select the one that achieves the highest accuracy and generalization on unseen data.
Model Deployment: Once we have chosen the best-performing model, we deploy it in a production environment where it can be used for real-world drug classification tasks. This involves integrating the model into existing systems and making it accessible via APIs or other interfaces.
